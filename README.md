# 🛰️ UART Transmitter & Receiver in SystemVerilog

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)** using **SystemVerilog**. It focuses on serial communication, one of the most essential protocols in embedded and digital system design.

The project includes a **UART Transmitter**, **UART Receiver**, and a complete **testbench** to simulate data transmission and reception. It’s built and verified using [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com), with waveform analysis via EPWave.

## 📌 Project Overview

UART is a serial communication protocol that transmits data one bit at a time, typically used in embedded systems to communicate with peripherals like sensors, displays, or other microcontrollers.

This implementation:
- Converts parallel data to serial (Transmitter)
- Sends it over a single line
- Reconstructs the original data back from the serial stream (Receiver)

## 📉 Simulation Outputs

- **TX Line** goes low (start bit), sends data LSB-first, then high (stop bit).
- **RX Line** samples data bits at the expected baud interval.
- **Testbench** confirms accurate reception via waveform or assertions.

---

## 🔧 Possible Extensions

- Add **parity bit** and **error checking**
- Parameterize the **baud rate** and **data length**
- Integrate with a **FIFO buffer**
- Build a complete **UART to memory-mapped bus bridge**
- Use **UVM** or **SystemVerilog assertions** for verification
